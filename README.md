Django Learning
This repository is dedicated to my journey in learning Django, a high-level Python web framework. I will be sharing my progress and any useful resources or tips I come across as I learn this powerful tool for building web applications.

What is Django?
Django is a free and open-source web framework written in Python. It is designed for building web applications with a clear and efficient layout, and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It is widely used for building high-performance, scalable web apps and is known for its “batteries included” philosophy, which means it comes with many built-in tools and features.

Progress
I will be updating this repository regularly with my progress and any resources or tips I find useful.
